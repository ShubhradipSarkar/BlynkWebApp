Subject: Request for Attendance Consideration due to Absence

Dear Mrs. Dasgupta,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to bring to your attention my recent absences from class due to illness. As a conscientious student, it is with regret that I was unable to attend the following class dates:

February 5, 2024
February 6, 2024
February 9, 2024
February 27, 2024
March 5, 2024
March 8, 2024
April 1, 2024
April 2, 2024
During these periods, I was under medical care and can provide all necessary documents, including prescriptions and medical reports, to verify my illness. Due to the nature of my condition, I was unable to attend classes as per the schedule.

I am Shubhradip Sarkar, a final year undergraduate student enrolled in the Industrial Biotechnology program at the National Institute of Technology Durgapur. My roll number is 20EC8030.

I kindly request your understanding and consideration regarding my attendance for the aforementioned dates. I assure you of my commitment to catching up on missed work and ensuring that my academic performance remains unaffected despite these unforeseen circumstances.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could update my attendance records accordingly and inform me of any additional steps or requirements from my end.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Should you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address].

Yours sincerely,

The dataset used in this project is called the "SOCR Earthquake Dataset", and it contains information about earthquakes that have occurred with a magnitude of 3.0 or greater in California, United States.
Each row in the dataset represents a single earthquake event and includes the following information:

Date and time of the earthquake in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
Latitude and longitude(in degree) of the epicenter, which is the point on the Earth's surface directly above where the earthquake occurred
Depth of the earthquake, measured in kilometers
Magnitude of the earthquake on the Richter scale
SRC = source
nst - number of stations used for solution (range: 0 to ...)
close - distance of closest station to epicenter (range: 0 to ...)
rms - root-mean-squared residual of solution (range: 0. to 1.)
gap - azimuthal gap (range: 0 to 360)
The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the magnitude of an earthquake based on the energy released by the earthquake. Each increase of one unit on the Richter scale represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the seismic waves generated by the earthquake.

The dataset contains earthquake events from January 2, 2017, to December 31, 2019, which includes a total of 37,706 earthquakes. This dataset could be used for a variety of purposes, such as studying earthquake patterns and trends over time or for predicting future earthquake activity
